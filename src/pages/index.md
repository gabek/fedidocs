# Fediverse Developer Network

## What is it?

- Build a community around those building for the Fediverse.
- Encourage interoperability between projects using the existing standards.
- Create a place where real-world examples and best practices around federating between projects can be documented.
- Provide future tooling, libraries, documentation and other resources to help new projects get started that support the Fediverse core protocols.
- A place where developers can directly contact other developers around Fediverse interoperability.

## What is it not?

- It's not a standards or governance body. The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) is behind ActivityPub and the [IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033) is behind WebFinger.
- It's not for changes or enhancements to the specs. See the [Fediverse Enhancement Proposals](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep).
