## Fediverse Developer Network

<img src="/img/fedidevs-concept.svg"/>

### What is it?

- A community for developers building the existing projects that make up the Fediverse.
- A starting point for developers looking to add Fediverse features to their existing projects or build something new that is Fediverse compatible.
- Encourage interoperability between projects using the existing standards.
- Maintain a single, shared repository of insights, examples, and best practices targeted at Fediverse developers intended to be easy to find and consume.
- Provide future tooling, libraries, documentation and other resources to help new projects get started that support the Fediverse core protocols.
- A place where developers can directly contact other developers around Fediverse interoperability.

### What is it not?

- It is not a standards or governance body. The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) is behind ActivityPub and the [IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033) is behind WebFinger.
- It is not for changes or enhancements to the specs. See the [Fediverse Enhancement Proposals](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep).
