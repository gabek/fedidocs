The `Delete` activity is used to remove objects from Funkwhale's database.

| Reference |                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Activity  | [Undo](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#delete-activity-inbox) |
| Object    | A Funkwhale `Library` or `Audio` object                              |

## Internal logic

When Funkwhale receives a `Delete` activity, it deletes the associated object from the database.

Funkwhale ensures the actor initiating the activity is the owner of the associated object before handling it.

## Example

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="library" label="Library">

In this example, **Bob** deletes a library and notifies its followers.

```json
{
   "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
      {}
   ],
   "type": "Delete",

   }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="audio" label="Audio">

In this example, **Bob** deletes three audio objects in a library and notifies the library's followers.
