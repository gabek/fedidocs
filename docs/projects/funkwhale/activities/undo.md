The `Undo` activity reverses a referenced [`Follow`](follow) activity.

| Reference |                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Activity  | [Undo](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#undo-activity-inbox) |
| Object    | A `Follow` activity                               |

## Internal logic

When Funkwhale receives an `Undo` activity, it deletes the corresponding [`Follow`](follow) from the database.

## Example

In this example, **Alice** notifies **Bob** that she's undoing her follow.
