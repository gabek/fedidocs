Kbin is a reddit-like content aggregator and microblogging platform running on the Fediverse network. It can
communicate with many other ActivityPub services, including Mastodon, Lemmy, Pleroma, Peertube. The initiative aims to
promote a free and open internet.

## What functionality does Kbin provide on the Fediverse?

The platform is divided into thematic categories called magazines. By default, any user can create their own magazine
and automatically become its owner. Then they receive a number of administrative tools that will help them personalize
and moderate the magazine, including appointing moderators from among other users. Content from the Fediverse is also
cataloged based on groups or tags. A registered user can follow magazines, other users or domains and create his own
personalized homepage. There is also the option to block unwanted topics.

Content can be posted on the main page - external links and more relevant articles or on microblog section - aggregating
short posts. All content can be additionally categorized and labeled. Great possibilities to search for interesting
topics and people easily is something that distinguishes Kbin. Platform is equally suitable for a small personal
instance for friends and family, a school or university community, company platform or a general instance with thousands
of active users.
